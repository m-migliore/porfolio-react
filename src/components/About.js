    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>My name is Matt Migliore, and I am a full stack web developer who loves the challenge of problem solving with code. I build beautiful, dynamic web applications through my experience with JavaScript, React, Redux, Ruby on Rails, HTML and CSS. I love solving puzzles, and I am determined to solve every puzzle that I encounter when coding.</p>
    <p>I attended the Flatiron School to strengthen my skillset. At the Flatiron School, I learned how to build dynamic web applications with a React/Redux frontend, and a Ruby on Rails backend. I graduated from Syracuse University, where I received a bachelor of science in information management and technology, and a minor in global enterprise technology. My concentrations were in web development and information security. </p>
    <p>I am from Commack, New York, which is on Long Island. I am a purple belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and I spend most of free time training. My other hobbies include playing video games, photography, snowboarding, and enjoying the outdoors.</p>
